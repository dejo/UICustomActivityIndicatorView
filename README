===========================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

This class is intended to provide an activity indicator view that includes
a text label next to the "spinning gear" all centered nicely within the
superview. It is similar to the one you see, for example, in the App Store
app when it is searching and displays the usual activity indicator (the
spinning gear) with a label reading "Loading..." next to it.

===========================================================================
BUILD REQUIREMENTS

Xcode 3.2.6

===========================================================================
RUNTIME REQUIREMENTS

iOS 3.0+

===========================================================================
SUPERCLASS:

This class is subclassed from UIView (but based on UIActivityIndicatorView)

===========================================================================
PROPERTIES:

This class provides one new property: an NSString named "text" to set the
text of the label; the ellipsis (i.e. the "...") is added automatically

===========================================================================
METHODS:

- (id) initWithActivityIndicatorStyle:text:superview
  This method is similar to UIActivityIndicatorView's
  initWithActivityIndicatorStyle: but adds parameters for the text string
  for the label and the superview for this view.

===========================================================================
KNOWN LIMITATIONS:

- If the text string you set is too long (> 20 chars), it will be truncated.
  Try to keep it short: as in, one or two words, especially when using the
  WhiteLarge style, in order to avoid truncation
- The styling of the text is not currently customizable but based on the
  indicator style

===========================================================================
SAMPLE USAGE:

Add the following code to a viewDidLoad:
	DEJOwareActivityIndicatorView *activityIndicatorView = [[DEJOwareActivityIndicatorView alloc]
		initWithActivityIndicatorStyle:UIActivityIndicatorViewStyleGray
		text:NSLocalizedString(@"Searching",@"Searching")
		superview:self.view];
Trigger the animation:
	[activityIndicatorView startAnimating];
